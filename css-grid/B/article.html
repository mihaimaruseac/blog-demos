      <main class="section main" role="main">
        <p>This is one paragraph of this article. It can spawn several lines
        but we don't care about that, do we?</p>

        <p>Besides Computer Science (and related topics), I also like history.
        I enjoy the piece which combine these topics. Such is the case of
        Knuth’s
        <a href="http://steiner.math.nthu.edu.tw/disk5/js/computer/1.pdf">
        <q>Ancient Babylonian Algorithms</q></a> which I found while reading
        the collection titled
        <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cs.html">
        <q>Selected Papers on Computer Science</q></a>.</p>

        <p>The paper turned out to be interesting because it offered new
        interesting insights beside the already known facts about ancient
        Summer. In fact, the first page of the article brings a significant
        piece of information. It is well known that Babylonians used a base 60
        system – with the caveat that they didn’t have a symbol for 0 at first
        and later they just used a gap for it. However, very few people know
        that floating point arithmetic was actually used in the land between
        Tigris and Euphrates.</p>

        <p>Let's just create a table here, just because we can:</p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Column 1</th>
            <th>Column 2</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>123456789</td>
            <td><b>987654321<b/></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>123456789</b></td>
            <td>987654321</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>In this paragraph we test some ligatures, such as fi, ffi, fl, ft,
        ti, fti and tfi.</p>

        <p>Don't forget to test special characters too, such as ă, ș, ț, €, ß,
        Ț, ”, „, «, », and ł.</p>

        <p>This is the final paragraph of this demo article. We already gave a
        spoiler of what's to come, didn't we?</p>
